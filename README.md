# What is this

The second pair programming assignment during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a Music Releases site**.

## How We started

We watched all the video material to prepare for the project. This was our first React project. We started by doing the components and left the styling for the end. When we created the components we started with the most general ones and continued into greater and greater detail.
We swapped driver/navigator throughout the project.

### What We struggled with and should improve for next pair programming project

As mentioned, this was our first encounter with React and it was a lot to take in. But even though it was a new concept that was challenging we managed to end the project with understanding it and even to finish the stretch goals. So rather than improve something for the next pair programming project both of us should take with us that sometimes it's better do discuss things that one dosen't understand than starting to google right away.

### What We're proud of

We're proud that we not only managed to go from feeling rather lost to understanding props, but even understand how to deconstruct them. Another thing were proud of is the code structure that is super organised, including the CSS.

## If We had more time

If we hade more time (and lived in the same city) we would celebrate with a drink!
